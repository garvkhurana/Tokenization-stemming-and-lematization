# Tokenization-stemming-and-lematization
NLP Learning Progress
Introduction
Welcome to my NLP Learning Progress repository! Here, I document my journey of learning Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. I'm excited to share my progress and the knowledge I've gained so far.

Current Focus
I'm currently focusing on mastering the fundamental techniques in NLP, including tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.

What I've Learned
1. Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units, typically words or sentences. I've learned various tokenization techniques such as:

Word Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words.
Sentence Tokenization: Splitting text into sentences.
2. Stemming
Stemming is the process of reducing words to their root form. I've explored different stemming algorithms like:

Porter Stemmer: A widely-used stemming algorithm.
Snowball Stemmer: An improved version of the Porter Stemmer with support for multiple languages.
3. Lemmatization
Lemmatization is similar to stemming but aims to obtain the base or dictionary form of a word. It considers the context and meaning of the word to produce a valid lemma. Techniques I've learned include:

WordNet Lemmatizer: Utilizing WordNet's lexical database for lemmatization.
SpaCy Lemmatization: Leveraging the SpaCy library for advanced lemmatization with part-of-speech tagging.
Future Plans
With a solid understanding of tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization, I plan to delve deeper into more advanced NLP concepts such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and language modeling.

Conclusion
I'm excited about my progress in learning NLP and look forward to exploring more advanced techniques and applications. Feel free to explore the code and documentation in this repository, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Happy coding!
